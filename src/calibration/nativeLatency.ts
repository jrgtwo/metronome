/**
 * Native output-latency provider — the seam between the web build and a future
 * Tauri shell.
 *
 * The web/Tone.js clock can only read `AudioContext.outputLatency`, which under-
 * reports (often badly) for Bluetooth output on non-Apple platforms — the BT
 * codec + OS mixer add latency Web Audio never sees. The real fix lives in
 * native code: on iOS/macOS, `AVAudioSession.outputLatency` reports the true
 * figure. That can only be reached from the Rust side of a Tauri shell, which
 * can't be built on this (Linux) machine.
 *
 * So we hide the difference behind this interface. The web implementation
 * returns `null` ("I can't measure it — fall back to the browser's own
 * outputLatency + manual calibration"). A later Tauri implementation will call
 * the Rust command (`invoke('get_output_latency')`) and return a real number.
 * Swapping `activeNativeLatency` is the ONLY change the calibration code needs
 * when the native bridge lands — no UI refactor.
